# Mean Shift Clustering

Mean Shift Clustering is a non-parametric feature-space analysis technique. It is a centroid-based algorithm, which works by updating candidates for centroids to be the mean of the points within a given region. These candidates are then filtered in a post-processing stage to eliminate near-duplicates, resulting in the final set of centroids.

# TODOs
- [ ] Implement Mean Shift Clustering
- [ ] Test with AoS
- [ ] Test with SoA
- [ ] create openmp version of MSC
